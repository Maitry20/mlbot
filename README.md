```

```

3. Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in the browser.

## How it works

1. Bot appears in center with intro speech bubble
2. After TTS completes, bot moves to top-left
3. Flash cards appear one by one with TTS narration
4. Each card stays for 1 second after TTS completes, then fades
5. Bot returns to center for outro message

The TTS feature works in modern browsers that support the Web Speech API. If TTS is not available, the timing will be simulated based on text length.
